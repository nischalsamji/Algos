	 *  Find number of squares in n*n matrix

	 *  for an m*n matrix where m > n
	 *  (1/6) * N *(N+1)* (3M-N+1)
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  Number of squares of size 1 would be: M*N
	 *  		Number of squares of size 2 would be: (M−1)*(N−1)
	 *  Extending this to calculate number of squares of size M (largest possible square) would be: (1)*(N−M+1)
	 *  The above yields a generalized equation of:  (1/6) * N *(N+1)* (3M-N+1)
